abstract = {Summary The viscosity of the mantle affects every aspect of the thermal and compositional evolution of Earth's interior. Radial variations in viscosity can affect the sinking of slabs, the morphology of plumes, and the rate of convective heat transport and thermal evolution. Below the mantle transition zone, we detect changes in the long-wavelength pattern of lateral heterogeneity in global tomographic models, a peak in the the depth-distribution of seismic scatterers, and changes in the dynamics plumes and slabs, which may be associated with a change in viscosity. We analyze the long-wavelength structures, radial correlation functions, and spectra of four recent global tomographic models and a suite of geodynamic models. We find that the depth-variations of the spectral slope in tomographic models are most consistent with a geodynamic model that contains both a dynamically significant phase transition and a reduced-viscosity region at the top of the lower mantle. We present new inferences of the mantle radial viscosity profile that are consistent with the presence of such a feature.},

abstract = {{Geochemical observations of ocean island and mid‐ocean ridge basalts suggest that abundances of heat‐producing elements (HPEs: U, Th, and K) vary within the mantle. Combined with bulk silicate Earth models and constraints on the Earth's heat budget, these observations suggest the presence of a more enriched (potentially deep and undepleted) reservoir in the mantle. Such a reservoir may be related to seismically observed deep mantle structures known as large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). LLSVPs might represent thermochemical piles of an intrinsically denser composition, and many studies have shown such piles to remain stable over hundreds of Myr or longer. However, few studies have examined if thermochemical piles can remain stable if they are enriched in HPEs, a necessary condition for them to constitute an enriched HPE reservoir. We conduct a suite of mantle convection simulations to examine the effect of HPE enrichment up to 25× the ambient mantle on pile stability. Model results are evaluated against present‐day pile morphology and tested for resulting seismic signatures using self‐consistent potential pile compositions. We find that stable piles can form from an initial basal layer of dense material even if the layer is enriched in HPEs, depending on the density of the layer and degree of HPE enrichment, with denser basal layers requiring increased HPE enrichment to form pile‐like morphology instead of a stable layer. Thermochemical piles or LLSVPs may therefore constitute an enriched reservoir in the deep mantle. The amount and distribution of radioactive heat‐producing elements within the mantle exert an important control on the thermal evolution of the mantle and core. Determining the composition of the mantle and its rate of heat production is difficult because several lines of evidence suggest that the Earth's mantle is not homogeneous, containing reservoirs of unmixed material. Such reservoirs may contain material enriched in radioactive elements and could be primordial, remaining isolated from the surface since Earth's formation. One possible physical location for such a reservoir is within “piles” of compositionally distinct material in the deep mantle. Such piles have been suggested by seismic observations, but it is unclear whether piles can persist if they are enriched in radioactive elements that heat the piles, promoting their buoyant rise and entrainment into the convecting mantle. We use geodynamic models to explore the dynamics of a compositionally distinct basal layer enriched in heat‐producing radioactive elements. We determine the conditions under which the layer can be organized into piles that remain stable over geological timescales. We find that piles can remain stable, and we are able to reconcile the dynamical requirements for stability with seismic observations using models of lower mantle physical properties. Thermochemical piles can be stable even if they are enriched in heat‐producing elements Piles could constitute a primordial/enriched mantle reservoir Seismic properties of enriched piles may be consistent with large low velocity provinces (LLSVPs)}},

abstract = {{Tomographic images of Earth's mantle reveal that structure, even at the largest spatial scales, does not remain correlated across all mantle depths. This is a surprising result given the relationship between a dominantly spherical harmonic degree‐2 pattern in the lower mantle and the pattern of plate motions at the surface, that is, the fact that the two large, low‐shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean are located near regions of surface divergence and away from regions of recent and ongoing subduction. Here, we combine analysis of seismic tomography models and numerical simulations of global‐scale mantle circulation to show that the change in correlation in mantle structure across the extended transition zone (400–1,000‐km depth), as revealed by the mantle radial correlation function (RCF), can be attributed primarily to the influence of seismically fast regions in the transition zone beneath the western Pacific subduction zones. Similar changes in the correlation of structure in global models of mantle circulation can be explained by a relatively large increase in viscosity (of at least a hundred times) between the upper mantle and lower mantle. We also demonstrate that a stronger endothermic phase transition at a depth of 660 km helps explain the observed pattern of the mantle RCF and the correlation between geodynamic models and seismic tomography. We account for the differences in resolution and parameterization of geodynamic versus tomographic models through the application of a tomographic resolution operator. Seismic images of Earth's mantle have revealed changes in mantle structure between 400‐ and 1,000‐km depths. The structures at these depths appear to be different in nature from the lowermost mantle or the asthenosphere. We demonstrate that the changes in structure are driven primarily by the accumulation of subducted oceanic plate material in the western Pacific basin. Next, we use numerical models of mantle convection to demonstrate that the observed structures can be best explained by a relatively large increase in mantle viscosity at 660‐km depth or perhaps somewhat deeper, near 1,000 km. Decorrelation in long‐wavelength mantle structure below the transition zone can be attributed to slab stagnation beneath the western Pacific Mantle radial correlation is best explained by an increase of at least a hundred times in viscosity at 660‐km depth An endothermic phase transition at a depth of 660 km improves the overall correlation between geodynamic models and seismic tomography}},

abstract = {{The thermal and chemical evolution of rocky planets is controlled by their surface tectonics and magmatic processes. On Earth, magmatism is dominated by plutonism/intrusion versus volcanism/extrusion. However, the role of plutonism on planetary tectonics and long‐term evolution of rocky planets has not been systematically studied. We use numerical simulations to systematically investigate the effect of plutonism combined with eruptive volcanism. At low‐to‐intermediate intrusion efficiencies, results reproduce the three common tectonic/convective regimes as are usually obtained in simulations using a viscoplastic rheology: stagnant‐lid (a one‐plate planet), episodic (where the lithosphere is usually stagnant and sometimes overturns into the mantle), and mobile‐lid (similar to plate tectonics). At high intrusion efficiencies, we observe a new additional regime called “plutonic‐squishy lid.” This regime is characterized by a set of small, strong plates separated by warm and weak regions generated by plutonism. Eclogitic drippings and lithospheric delaminations often occur close to these weak regions, which leads to significant surface velocities toward the focus of delamination, even if subduction is not active. The location of the plate boundaries is strongly time dependent and mainly occurs in regions of magma intrusion, leading to small, ephemeral plates. The plutonic‐squishy‐lid regime is also distinctive from other regimes because it generates a thin lithosphere, which results in high conductive heat fluxes and lower internal mantle temperatures when compared to a stagnant lid. This regime has the potential to be applicable to the Early Archean Earth and present‐day Venus, as it combines elements of both protoplate tectonic and vertical tectonic models. The evolution of Earth‐like planets is controlled by the dynamics of their rigid outer part, called the lithosphere, and magmatic processes. Studies of terrestrial magmatic processes show that most melt is intruded into the crust. However, the effect of intrusive magmatism on the long‐term evolution of rocky planets has not been systematically studied. Here we use numerical models to simulate global mantle convection in a rocky planet. When eruptions dominate, our results reproduce the three tectonic regimes found in previous studies: mobile lid, similar to plate tectonics operating on modern‐day Earth; stagnant lid or a planet covered by a single plate; and episodic lid where the planet is covered by one plate that resurfaces into the mantle more or less frequently. For high intrusion efficiencies, we describe the new “plutonic‐squishy‐lid” regime. Hot intrusions make the lithosphere squishy and lead to drippings and delaminations of the crust. In turn, these processes lead to significant surface velocities (even if subduction is not active), and small, short‐lived plates. The lithosphere is kept thin, and therefore, the loss of heat from the interior is efficient. The new regime has the potential to be applicable to the Archean Earth and Venus. High intrusion efficiencies lead to a new global tectonic regime, named plutonic‐squishy lid The new regime is characterized by significant surface velocities, a thin lithosphere, and small plates The new regime has the potential to be applicable to the Archean Earth and Venus}},

abstract = {{The Earth is in a plate tectonics regime with high surface heat flow concentrated at constructive plate boundaries. Other terrestrial bodies that lack plate tectonics are thought to lose their internal heat by conduction through their lids and volcanism: hotter planets (Io and Venus) show widespread volcanism whereas colder ones (modern Mars and Mercury) are less volcanically active. However, studies of terrestrial magmatic processes show that less than 20\% of melt volcanically erupts, with most melt intruding into the crust. Signatures of large magmatic intrusions are also found on other planets. Yet, the influence of intrusive magmatism on planetary cooling remains unclear. Here we use numerical magmatic-thermo-mechanical models to simulate global mantle convection in a planetary interior. In our simulations, warm intrusive magmatism acts to thin the lithosphere, leading to sustained recycling of overlying crustal material and cooling of the mantle. In contrast, volcanic eruptions lead to a thick lithosphere that insulates the upper mantle and prevents efficient cooling. We find that heat loss due to intrusive magmatism can be particularly efficient compared to volcanic eruptions if the partitioning of heat-producing radioactive elements into the melt phase is weak. We conclude that the mode of magmatism experienced by rocky bodies determines the thermal and compositional evolution of their interior.}},
